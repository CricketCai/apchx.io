# apchx.io
Helicopter Game

Apchx.io is a multiplayer rpg centered around florr, and has players as helicopters, defeating mobs in a battleground-themed map. The map will include both waves and florr's 2019-21 legacy map, as well as a pvp world map. 

The spinning of petals in florr will be replaced with "blades" that mobs drop so that users can use their helicopter rotors to defeat mobs, armor will give protection against mobs (and players in pvp), and turrets will substitute for projectiles in florr (eg. missile, carrot, web). 

The rarity system will be the same style as florr, with 2-3 more rarities above super [omnipotent, quantum] and a rarity below common [effortless]. 

Outcrowding will be nonexistant; squads are based on level, and progressing solo will be as efficient as progressing in a squad. Rng carries will be less notable, as skill + effort > luck.
